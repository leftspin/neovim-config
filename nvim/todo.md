# Colors that should have Clarity shades

- text matches (shift-8) should be yellow.
  However it should be a bg that's off-blue
  from the background, and the text should be
  yellow,
- warning diagnostics color should be yellow

* hover matches (where you hover your cursor over
  a token and it highlights that same token anywhere
  on the screen) should be a brighter blood orange.
  - If you want to push _#3B2F28_ further toward blood
    orange, making it warmer while still retaining
    some of its dark depth, here are two adjusted options:
  1. #4D271B – A deeper burnt umber shade with stronger warm
     undertones, sitting between dark navy and blood orange.
  2. #5A2314 – A richer, more pronounced reddish-brown that
     leans closer to blood orange while still maintaining darkness.

# Misc

- cyan color should be duller (like in const)
